# Task 4: RoleAuth Filter for Authorization

## ✅ Task 4 Complete - Security Filter Implemented

### **RoleAuth Filter Implementation**
- **File**: `app/Filters/RoleAuth.php`
- **Purpose**: Prevents unauthorized access to role-specific routes
- **Security**: Protects against URL manipulation attacks

## 🔒 Access Control Rules

### **Admin Users** (`role = 'admin'`):
- ✅ Can access any route starting with `/admin/`
- ✅ Examples: `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/users`, `/admin/reports`, `/admin/settings`

### **Teacher Users** (`role = 'instructor'`):
- ✅ Can only access routes starting with `/teacher/`
- ✅ Examples: `/teacher/dashboard`
- ❌ Cannot access `/admin/*` or `/student/*` routes

### **Student Users** (`role = 'student'`):
- ✅ Can access routes starting with `/student/`
- ✅ Can access `/announcements` route
- ✅ Examples: `/student/courses`, `/student/assignments`, `/student/grades`, `/announcements`
- ❌ Cannot access `/admin/*` or `/teacher/*` routes

### **Common Routes** (All logged-in users):
- ✅ Home, About, Contact, Logout, Announcements pages

## 🚨 Security Features

### **Unauthorized Access**:
- **Action**: Redirect to `/announcements`
- **Message**: "Access Denied: Insufficient Permissions"
- **Flash Message**: Error displayed to user

### **Not Logged In**:
- **Action**: Redirect to `/login`
- **Requirement**: Must be logged in to access protected routes

## 🎯 Login Redirection (As Required)

### **After Successful Login**:
- **Admin** → `/admin/dashboard` ✅
- **Teacher** → `/teacher/dashboard` ✅  
- **Student** → `/announcements` ✅

## 🛡️ Protected Routes

### **Admin Routes** (Requires admin role):
```
/admin/dashboard
/admin/users
/admin/reports  
/admin/settings
```

### **Teacher Routes** (Requires instructor role):
```
/teacher/dashboard
```

### **Student Routes** (Requires student role):
```
/student/courses
/student/assignments
/student/grades
```

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### **Filter**:
- ✅ **Created** `app/Filters/RoleAuth.php` - Authorization filter

### **Configuration**:
- ✅ **Modified** `app/Config/Filters.php` - Registered RoleAuth filter
- ✅ **Modified** `app/Config/Routes.php` - Applied filter to route groups

### **Security Implementation**:
- ✅ Route groups with `['filter' => 'roleauth']` protection
- ✅ Session-based role verification
- ✅ Proper error handling and redirection

## 🧪 Testing the Security

### **Test Cases**:

1. **Admin Access Test**:
   - Login as admin → Should go to `/admin/dashboard`
   - Try accessing `/teacher/dashboard` → Should be denied with error

2. **Teacher Access Test**:
   - Login as teacher → Should go to `/teacher/dashboard`
   - Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` → Should be denied with error

3. **Student Access Test**:
   - Login as student → Should go to `/announcements`
   - Try accessing `/admin/dashboard` → Should be denied with error
   - Try accessing `/student/courses` → Should work

4. **URL Manipulation Test**:
   - Manually type restricted URLs → Should be blocked by filter

## ✅ Task 4 Requirements Met:
1. ✅ Generated RoleAuth filter
2. ✅ Implemented session-based role checking
3. ✅ Admin access to `/admin/*` routes only
4. ✅ Teacher access to `/teacher/*` routes only  
5. ✅ Student access to `/student/*` and `/announcements` only
6. ✅ Unauthorized access redirects to `/announcements` with error message
7. ✅ Registered filter in `app/Config/Filters.php`
8. ✅ Applied filter to protected route groups in `app/Config/Routes.php`

**Security Status**: ✅ **SECURED** - URL manipulation attacks now blocked!
